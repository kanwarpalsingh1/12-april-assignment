    "Q1. Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) reduces overfitting in decision trees by training multiple trees on different bootstrap samples of the original dataset and averaging their predictions. By introducing randomness through bootstrapping and aggregating the predictions, bagging reduces the variance of the model, which helps in generalizing better to unseen data and mitigating overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Advantages of using different types of base learners in bagging:\n",
    "\n",
    "Diversity in base learners can lead to better overall performance of the ensemble.\n",
    "Each base learner may capture different aspects or patterns in the data, leading to more robust predictions.\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "Too much diversity might lead to decreased performance if the base learners are not complementary.\n",
    "More complex base learners may increase computational complexity and training time.\n",
    "Q3. The choice of base learner affects the bias-variance tradeoff in bagging.\n",
    "Using low-bias, high-variance models as base learners (e.g., deep decision trees) tends to decrease bias but increase variance. Bagging then reduces this increased variance, resulting in a net improvement in the bias-variance tradeoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Yes, bagging can be used for both classification and regression tasks. \n",
    "In classification tasks, bagging involves training multiple classifiers (e.g., decision trees) on different bootstrapped samples of the data and aggregating their predictions through voting or averaging. In regression tasks, the same approach is applied, but instead of classification, the predictions of the base models are averaged to obtain the final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. The ensemble size in bagging refers to the number of base learners included in the ensemble.\n",
    "Generally, increasing the ensemble size improves the stability and robustness of the model, leading to better performance, up to a certain point. However, after a certain threshold, increasing the ensemble size may not yield significant improvements and may increase computational complexity. The optimal ensemble size depends on the specific problem and dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Real-world application of bagging in machine learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Predicting customer churn in a telecommunications company: Bagging can be used to train an ensemble of decision trees on different subsets of customer data to predict whether a customer is likely to churn or not. By aggregating the predictions of multiple trees, the model can provide more accurate predictions and help the company identify at-risk customers more effectively.\n",
